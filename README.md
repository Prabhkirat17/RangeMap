# IntervalMapper

IntervalMapper is a C++ project that implements an interval mapping data structure (`interval_map`) and provides a set of test cases to verify its functionality.

## Overview

The `interval_map` class is designed to map intervals of integer keys to values. It allows assigning a value to a range of keys efficiently. The project includes implementation files, test cases, and a CMake build system.

### Requirements

- C++11 compatible compiler
- CMake 3.10 or higher
- Google Test (GTest) framework (automatically downloaded by CMake)
